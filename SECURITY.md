## üì¨ Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously‚Äîespecially in decentralized, wallet-connected, and culturally licensed environments.

If you believe you've found a vulnerability (XSS, open redirect, logic bypass, smart contract risk, etc.), please **report it confidentially** by emailing:

Please include:

- Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Environment (e.g., browser, device, blockchain network)
- Screenshots or code snippets (if available)
- Estimated impact

## ‚è≥ What Happens Next?

- You‚Äôll receive a confirmation reply within **3 working days**.
- We aim to validate and patch any valid issues within **7‚Äì14 days** depending on severity.
