# 🔐 Security Policy

## 🧩 Supported Versions

We use a modular, license-scoped release model: only license holders receive **a handed-over repository** with a tagged stable release; ongoing support is advisory-only (consultation, guidance, direction) and is provided solely for handed-over releases that are actively **run in production and intended for further development**, with all execution (updates, security tasks, implementations) performed by the Licensee.

Read the **release notes** on all [**PABRIKROTI's release**](https://github.com/myreceiptt/pabrikroti-master/releases).

## 📬 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously—especially in decentralized, wallet-connected, and culturally licensed environments.

If you believe you've found a vulnerability (XSS, open redirect, logic bypass, smart contract risk, etc.), please **report it confidentially** by emailing:

📩 [security@endhonesa.com](mailto:security@endhonesa.com)

Please include:

- Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Environment (e.g., browser, device, blockchain network)
- Screenshots or code snippets (if available)
- Estimated impact

---

## ⏳ What Happens Next?

- You’ll receive a confirmation reply within **3 working days**.
- We aim to validate and patch any valid issues within **7–14 days** depending on severity.
- Critical issues may trigger immediate `hotfix` patches, while non-critical ones are included in the next scheduled release.
- If the vulnerability is valid, you will be **credited (unless anonymity is requested)**.

---

## 🙅 Do Not Do These

- Publish exploits before coordinated disclosure
- Open GitHub issues for vulnerabilities
- Attempt unauthorized access to other users’ wallets or data
