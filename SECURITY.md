If you're using a customized fork or internal derivative based on PABRIKROTI, we recommend merging upstream patches manually or contacting our security team.

## 📬 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously—especially in decentralized, wallet-connected, and culturally licensed environments.

If you believe you've found a vulnerability (XSS, open redirect, logic bypass, smart contract risk, etc.), please **report it confidentially** by emailing:

📩 [security@endhonesa.com](mailto:security@endhonesa.com)

Please include:

- Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Environment (e.g., browser, device, blockchain network)
- Screenshots or code snippets (if available)
- Estimated impact

## ⏳ What Happens Next?

- You’ll receive a confirmation reply within **3 working days**.
- We aim to validate and patch any valid issues within **7–14 days** depending on severity.
- Critical issues may trigger immediate `hotfix` patches, while non-critical ones are included in the next scheduled release.
- If the vulnerability is valid, you will be **credited (unless anonymity is requested)**.

## 🙅 Do Not...

- Publish exploits before coordinated disclosure
- Open GitHub issues for vulnerabilities
- Attempt unauthorized access to other users’ wallets or data
